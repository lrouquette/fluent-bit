# About

We maintain a set of patches on top of upstream fluent-bit. They need to be
semantically versioned as well so we understand, for example, that we're
upgrading a fix version of fluent-bit vs. a fix version of our patches.

The scheme is quite simple. The upstream version is first, followed by a hyphen,
followed by our version:

```
F stands for Fluent-Bit
A stands for Adobe's changes

{F major}.{F minor}.{F fix}-{A major}.{A minor}.{A fix}-adobe
```
